# A Basic Guide to Reproducible Research
**ATTENTION**: This is a work in progress and subject to major changes.


This repository contains the code for [A Basic Guide to Reproducible Research](https://binste.github.io/basic_reproducibility_guide/). The guide is one of two parts of my master thesis (2018) at the University of Zurich under the supervision of [Prof. Pietro Biroli](https://sites.google.com/site/pietrobiroli/home). The second one is a [policy evaluation of Chicago's Safe Passage program](https://binste.github.io/chicago_safepassage_evaluation/), which serves as an example for the practices advertised in this guide.
