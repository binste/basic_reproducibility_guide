There is one last thing I want to talk about, which is how to tie what we have looked at so far together in a readme file. The readme file will be the entry point for visitors to your project on GitHub. We will use it to explain what is contained in the repository and how this can be used to reproduce the results. You can write the readme file as a markdown (.md) or text (.txt) file, and it will be automatically detected by GitHub and displayed when someone visits your repository. In the following, I'll talk about what sections to include and what they should contain.

## Overview
{:.no_toc}
This repository contains an analysis of the effect of Chicago's Safe Passage program on crime counts. The program aims at keeping students safe on their way to school by posting civilian guards along various routes to the participating schools. The empirical approach chosen for the analysis follows one of the specifications in the working paper ["Do More Eyes on the Street Reduce Crime? Evidence from Chicagoâ€™s Safe Passage Program"](https://ignaciomsarmiento.github.io/assets/Safe_Passage_WP.pdf) by Daniel McMillen, Ignacio Sarmiento-Barbieri, and Ruchi Singh from June 22, 2017, and is an attempt to replicate their findings. For more information on the replication, as well as an introduction on the topic and a summary of the analysis and the results, see the corresponding [website](https://binste.github.io/chicago_safepassage_evaluation/).

This policy evaluation is one of two parts of my master thesis (2018) at the University of Zurich under the supervision of [Prof. Pietro Biroli](https://sites.google.com/site/pietrobiroli/home). The second one is [A Basic Guide to Reproducible Research](https://binste.github.io/basic_reproducibility_guide/), where this analysis serves as an example.

## Replicate analysis
{:.no_toc}
### Compare results to McMillen et al. (2017) and replicate figures from website
{:.no_toc}
By clicking on the badge below, you can compare the results to the ones of McMillen et al. (2017) and replicate the figures used on the website  of the analysis, all directly in your browser without any setup required.

### Run analysis on your own machine
{:.no_toc}
Due to resource constraints on the above used service called mybinder.org, you can not run the estimations of the Poisson regression or even start out from the raw data files in your browser. If you want to do that, you need to do it on your own machine. To do it, you might want to choose one of the following two options, depending on your knowledge and your goal.

#### Set up a conda environment
{:.no_toc}
If you want to continue working on this project, your best option might be to clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/binste/chicago_safepassage_evaluation
```
and then install and activate the conda environment by running:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
source activate speval
```
Now start a Jupyter notebook server in the root directory of the project:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
See [Order of execution](#order-of-execution) on how to proceed.

This approach should give you the exact same Python and R version as well as the same versions of the main packages used. However, system dependencies might differ and I was not able to test it on a Windows machine. Should you experience any problem with this, you might want to try out the next approach.

#### Run it in a Docker container
{:.no_toc}
If you want to rerun the analysis in an isolated and tested environment, you can use the amazing tool repo2docker. It will copy the repository on your own computer and setup everything for you in an isolated and OS independent environment (using Docker). However, if you are not familiar with Docker, it is not straightforward to save any changes you make to the files.

1. Install the [Docker Community Edition](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community) for your operating system
2. Set the available memory for Docker to 4GB.
    * On Mac this can be set by clicking on the Docker symbol in the status bar -> Preferences -> Advanced
3. Install repo2docker from source to get the latest version:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker.git
    cd repo2docker
    pip install -e .
    ```
4. Build and launch Docker image of GitHub repository:
    ```bash
    jupyter-repo2docker https://github.com/binste/chicago_safepassage_evaluation
    ```
5. After it run through, there is an URL, which will lead you to a running Jupyter notebook server. There is currently a bug with Jupyter notebooks and Docker, where the displayed URL might not work without a slight modification. To fix it, change the host name before the port to `127.0.0.1`. Example: `http://d2f78b8191fd:55484/?token=...` becomes `http://127.0.0.1:55484/?token=...`.

See [Order of execution](#order-of-execution) on how to proceed.

### Data
{:.no_toc}
For a detailed description of all data sources used, see the section "Data" in the Appendix (XXX).

With the exception of the crime dataset, all raw data files are provided under `data/raw`. The crime dataset is over 1.5 GB and could therefore not be hosted on GitHub. However, the notebook in the folder `0_download_data` will by default download it for you and put it in the correct folder. The information on crimes should not change much for the years used in this analysis and therefore a download from the original source should work.

Some of the processed datasets are included. However, the dataset used to estimate the Poisson regressions (`est_df`) could, due to its size, not be uploaded to GitHub. It will be reproduced if you follow the order of execution explained in the following.

### Order of execution
{:.no_toc}
To reconstruct the results starting out from the raw data, run all notebooks in the `notebooks` folders in order of their numbering. No other scripts have to be run apart from the notebooks. The `src` folder does contain scripts with only functions, which are imported by the notebooks.

Should you want to run the whole pipeline with one command you can do this using the Python script `run_ipynb.py` which resides in the root folder of the project. Note however, that this will not give you much of an indication on the progress of the computations, you'll only see the name of the notebook currently processed. In the "Home" view of Jupyter notebook (where you can open files), click on the top right on "New" -> "Terminal". Now you should be able to run the following command to rerun the whole analysis from the raw data files to the end results:

```bash
python run_ipynb.py 0_download_data 1_prepare_data 2_crime_database 3_match 4_combine_for_analysis 5_analysis
```

This can take up to multiple hours, depending on your hardware.

### Analysis notebooks
{:.no_toc}
As the analysis notebooks are probably of the most interest, as they produce the main figures and results, the main two are briefly described in the following. They can be found in the folder `notebooks/5_analysis`.

| Notebook | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0.0-binste-estimation-poisson.ipynb` | Estimates all the Poisson regressions for both violent and property crimes and saves models as well as results into the folder `model`.
| `1.0-binste-analyze-crime-results-census-block-level.ipynb` | Replicates Figure 3, Figure A.2, Table 1, and Table 10 (column 3 and 7) from McMillen et al. (2017) and compares them to the originals. The notebook also produces additional figures for the website. |

> **Tip**: To view static versions of the Jupyter notebooks in your browser, you can paste their url into [Jupyter nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

### Hardware
{:.no_toc}
I used a MacBook Pro (macOS High Sierra 10.13.5) 3.1 GHz Intel Core i5 with 16 GB RAM to develop the project. No graphic card is needed. The end results were tested and replicated in a Docker container, as explained [above](#run-it-in-a-docker-container).

### Overview
At the top of the readme file, include a brief description of the project and its goals. You should not go into detail here on the methods and results used (ideally, you have done this written down in some other place that you can link to now, like an academic paper, website, blog post, Jupyter notebook, etc. This section should simply provide some context and refer to the main written part of the research project.

### Software environment
To rerun your code and reproduce the results, others need to know what software you used (and the respective version numbers). You can specify this directly in the readme file in form of a list or table, but there also exists a less tedious way. If you used the package manager conda and created a new environment for your project, you can automatically create an environment file which contains detailed information on the R or Python version used as well as on all additional packages.

First, activate the environment as usual, then enter the following command in your terminal:
```bash
conda env export > environment.yml
```
This exports the specifications of your environment into a file called `environment.yml`. You can then add it to your repository on GitHub (like any other file), and it can be used by someone else to replicate your environment by downloading it and running:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
The name of the copied environment will be by default the same one you have used and can be changed in the first line of the file.

Now you can simply mention in the readme file what programming language was used and then refer to the `environment.yml` file for details on the exact version and any additional packages. Don't forget to also add some information on your operating system.

**Note**: Your `environment.yml` file can become rather cluttered after you have installed many packages. Some of them will be system-specific dependencies which conda installed automatically and can prevent the installation of the environment on a different operating system. To make it easier for others, you might want to keep only the packages in the list which you actually installed and used in a script or notebook. You can then create a new environment from the edited file (first change the name of the environment) and rerun your analysis, to see if it still works.

### Hardware
Depending on your analysis, there might be certain requirements regarding the hardware needed to run it. It is helpful if you specify this in the readme file, so that others can better assess if they are able to rerun the analysis on their machine. At a minimum, provide some information on the total amount of memory needed and if a graphic card is required.

### Data
In the section on "Documentation", you have created a document containing information about your raw data files. In your readme file you can now simply refer to this documentation and briefly summarize if data has to be bought, downloaded for free, or if it is already available in the GitHub repository.

### Order of execution
Another very important section in your readme file should provide information on what to run in what order to get from the raw data files described in the previous section to the final results of your research project. You can make a numbered list of files to run in order or describe it in words (eg. "First execute `.../0.0-bis-download_data.ipynb`, then ..., to reproduce all the main figures and tables in the paper"). To make this even easier for visitors, you can also provide a single script/notebook which runs all the necessary files in the correct order. This is extremely useful for reproducibility and also serves as sort of a documentation of your workflow. If you work with Jupyter notebooks, you can use a small example script that I wrote:

{% capture runscript %}
```python
"""Runs all Jupyter notebooks in given folders. Folder names (one or multiple)
can be passed as arguments to the script and can be provided relative to the
folder which contains all notebooks (e.g. "notebooks").
Notebooks are run with their enclosing folder as working directory.

Example
-------
If you have a folder structure as advised in the section on "Folder structure,"
you can put this script in the root folder of your project, and then if you wanted to run all Jupyter notebooks in "notebooks/0_prepare_data," you
type the following command in your terminal (with the directory
set to the root folder):

$ python run_ipynb.py 0_prepare_data
