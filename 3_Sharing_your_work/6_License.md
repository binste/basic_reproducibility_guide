>*"When you make a creative work (which includes code), the work is under exclusive copyright by default. Unless you include a license that specifies otherwise, nobody else can use, copy, distribute, or modify your work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation. Once the work has other contributors (each a copyright holder), “nobody” starts including you."* - [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/){:target="_blank"}

Therefore, if you want others to be able to use your code to reproduce and/or build upon your findings, you have to explicitly allow this by adding a corresponding license to your GitHub repository. Head over to [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/){:target="_blank"} to find out which license suits your needs best.

Select your preferred license from the website, copy the license text into a file called LICENSE (without a file ending), and put it in the root directory of your project and put it on GitHub.
