To allow others to use your code to reproduce the findings or build upon them, you have to allow this explicitly by adding a corresponding license to your GitHub repository. Head over to [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/){:target="_blank"} to find out what license suits best your needs.

Select your preferred license from the website, copy the license text into a file called LICENSE (without a file ending) and put it in the root directory of your project (root directory of repository) and push it to GitHub. For example, this website and its corresponding GitHub repository are published under the permissive MIT license.
