# ATTENTION: WORK IN PROGRESS



This website presents a very basic workflow which makes your next data analysis reproducible by others. It tries to be the guide I'd have liked before doing my first empirical project during my studies in Economics at University.

>*“Only results that can be replicated are truly scientific results. If there is no chance to replicate
research results, they can be regarded as no more than personal views in the opinion or review
section of a daily newspaper.”* - [Huschka (2013)](https://www.ratswd.de/dl/RatSWD_WP_216.pdf){:target="_blank"}

Throughout the tutorial I'll try to convey only the most important information and leave links to websites where you can find additional information should you be interested. Furthermore for every step there are a lot of good options/tools to use, I won't go into detail and compare them but just show one possible way to keep this as simple as possible.

## Tools
As a programming language I recommend using either R or Python. They both are open-source and have huge ecosystems of extensions and tutorials behind them. In a later section I'll go into the details on setting them up in a way which is favorable for reproducible research. If you want to use one of them and are completely new to it, I recommend that you first get up to speed with [these tutorials](../help_snippets/starter_python_r.md) before continuing with this guide. However, note that this guide and the tools presented are applicable to most of the commonly used languages for data analysis such as Stata, Julia, Scala, and Matlab.

The tutorial is split into three parts.

1. [Preparation and setup](./1_Preparation/)
2. [During the analysis](./2_During_the_analysis/)
3. [Sharing your work](./3_Sharing_your_work/)

I furthermore compiled this [list of tutorials and documentations](./Where_to_go_next.md) which go more in-depth on reproducible research.

## About
This website was part of my thesis for obtaining a Master of Arts in Economics (major) and Data Science (minor) at the University of Zurich. A second part was an evaluation of the effectiveness of a crime prevention program in Chicago. You can find an overview of the analysis on [this website](https://binste.github.io/chicago_safepassage_evaluation/). The code in the corresponding [GitHub repository](https://github.com/binste/chicago_safepassage_evaluation) can be seen as an example of an application of the practices advertised in this guide. Throughout the guide you will find this symbol ![example_icon](./_figures/example_icon.png), which will take you to an example of the policy evaluation which shows the advertised practise.

# Reproducible research
[Here](./Reproducible_research.md) you can find some information on what reproducible research is and why it is important, not only for others but also for yourself. Should you already be convinced just skip it and jump right into the [Preparation and Setup](./1_Preparation/) section.
